1. Modify target.txt if you want to change the location of the bin in the calculation result of .xml or just keep default
2. Modify write_data_default.bin or keep default
3. Put your .xml and .bin in the same folder
4. Run ```modBIN_withXML.py``` or ```M1Inject.exe``` in cmd window and attach the arguments you want to use.
5. Input the corresponding information based on the program's feedback.

Note: Only use the argument -y is great

Note: Use ```-h``` if you need more information for arguments 

Note: Do NOT modify the data in the folder keep_default_bin, in case the wrong .bin file can be restored manually
